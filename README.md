The project is an Airport Management System GUI application using Python Tkinter. 
It enables users to input and manage passenger and flight information, storing data in a MySQL database. 
The program includes features such as adding, deleting, and displaying passenger and flight records. 
It also has a dedicated section for employee information with its own window. 
The project involves various interconnected tables in the database.
The program uses the MySQL connector to interact with a MySQL database and handles exceptions for error handling. 
Overall, it's a comprehensive application for managing airport-related information with a graphical user interface.
There are some issues in the deletion part, and they will be resolved soon.

To install the MySQL Connector for Python, you can use the mysql-connector-python package. You can install it using the following command:
pip install mysql-connector-python
There are 14 Tables which are interconnected using the SQL.
Keep the data types consistent between the values you entered in the GUI and the corresponding data types in the SQL code.
